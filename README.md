# Goal of the project
Financial fraud is a growing global concern, costing businesses and individuals billions of dollars every year. Traditional fraud detection methods are often rule-based and prone to failure when fraudsters develop new strategies. AI-based models like Random Forest Classifier can analyze vast amounts of transactional data, identify hidden patterns, and detect fraudulent activities in real-time with high accuracy.

# AI-Based Fraudulent Transaction Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging a **Random Forest Classifier**. The dataset is preprocessed, trained, and evaluated to ensure high accuracy in fraud detection. Various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score are used to assess the model's effectiveness.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
- Training on a **Random Forest Classifier**
- Model evaluation using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**
- Visualizing results using **Seaborn and Matplotlib**

## Dataset
The dataset consists of financial transaction records with labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0). Features include transaction amount, time, location, and other relevant attributes.

## Installation & Requirements
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Required Libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

## üîç Data Preprocessing
1. Handle missing values
2. Encode categorical features
3. Split data into training and testing sets

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Model Training
The Random Forest Classifier is trained with the following configuration:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_depth=5, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
## Why random forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness. It is an excellent choice for fraud detection due to the following reasons:
1. High Accuracy & Robustness
2. Handles Imbalanced Data Well
3. Feature Importance Analysis
4. Works Well with Small to Medium-Sized Datasets
5. Scalability & Efficiency
   
## üìä Model Evaluation
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred)
```
**Model Performance:**
- Accuracy: **99.23%**
- Precision: **High**
- Recall: **Optimized for fraud detection**
- ROC-AUC Score: **Excellent performance**

## Results & Visualization
Graphs and plots are used to analyze the dataset and model performance:
- Correlation heatmap
- Fraud distribution plot
- Feature importance visualization

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning models such as **LSTMs** for sequential analysis
- Explore **XGBoost** for better fraud detection
- Optimize hyperparameters for better generalization

## Real-Time Use Cases & Applications
- Banking & Finance
   - Detect fraudulent transactions in credit/debit card payments
   - Prevent account takeovers and unauthorized logins
-  E-Commerce & Online Payments
    - Identify fake transactions in platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Flipkart
    - Prevent chargeback fraud and unauthorized refunds
- Cryptocurrency & Blockchain
    - Spot suspicious transactions in crypto exchanges
    - Prevent money laundering and illicit activities
- Government & Cybersecurity
      - Detect tax fraud and money laundering schemes 
      - Identify fraudulent welfare claims and benefits misuse
  
## Conclusion
This project successfully identifies fraudulent transactions with high accuracy, leveraging **Random Forest** and data preprocessing techniques. Future work can focus on improving model robustness and efficiency.
